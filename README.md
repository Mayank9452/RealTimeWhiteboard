# Objective
Create a web application using React that allows users to upload images and receive real-time predictions from a pre-trained machine learning model. The application should be able to classify the uploaded images into multiple categories.

# Minimum Requirements:

* Users can create a new whiteboard session or join an existing one.
* The whiteboard should support drawing using different colors and brush sizes.
* Implement the ability to undo/redo the last action on the whiteboard.
* Users should be able to see the cursors of other connected users moving in real-time, indicating their drawing actions.
* Add an option to save the whiteboard content as an image or PDF file.
* Implement authentication (user signup and login) to ensure that only authorized users can access the whiteboard.
* The application should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices.
